# AWS IoT Device SDK for C++ v2

This document provides information about the AWS IoT device SDK for C++ V2.

If you have any issues or feature requests, please file an issue or pull request.

This SDK is built on the AWS Common Runtime, a collection of libraries
([aws-c-common](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-common),
[aws-c-io](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-io),
[aws-c-mqtt](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-mqtt),
[aws-c-http](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-http),
[aws-c-cal](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-cal),
[aws-c-auth](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-auth),
[s2n](https://github.com/awslabs/s2n)...) written in C to be
cross-platform, high-performance, secure, and reliable. The libraries are bound
to C++ by the [aws-crt-cpp](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-cpp) package.

## Installation

### Minimum Requirements

* C++ 11 or higher
* CMake 3.1+
* Clang 3.9+ or GCC 4.8+ or MSVC 2015+

### Build from source

#### Automatically Build and Install AWS Dependencies

Note: `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` can be any path where the project needs to be installed. Taking sdk-cpp-workspace as an example here.

#### MacOS and Linux

``` sh
mkdir sdk-cpp-workspace
cd sdk-cpp-workspace
git clone --recursive https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2.git
mkdir aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2-build
cd aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2-build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<absolute path sdk-cpp-workspace dir>" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="<Release|RelWithDebInfo|Debug>" ../aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2
cmake --build . --target install
```

#### Windows

``` sh
mkdir sdk-cpp-workspace
cd sdk-cpp-workspace
git clone --recursive https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2.git
mkdir aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2-build
cd aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2-build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<absolute path sdk-cpp-workspace dir>" ../aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2
cmake --build . --target install --config "<Release|RelWithDebInfo|Debug>"
```

Due to maximum path length limitations in the Windows API, we recommend cloning to a short path like: `C:\dev\iotsdk`

`--config` is only REQUIRED for multi-configuration build tools (VisualStudio/MsBuild being the most common).
