# AWS IoT SDK for C++ v2
This document provides information about the AWS IoT device SDK for C++ V2.

If you have any issues or feature requests, please file an issue or pull request.

This SDK is built on the AWS Common Runtime, a collection of libraries
([aws-c-common](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-common),
[aws-c-io](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-io),
[aws-c-mqtt](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-mqtt),
[aws-c-http](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-http),
[aws-c-cal](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-cal),
[aws-c-auth](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-auth),
[s2n](https://github.com/awslabs/s2n)...) written in C to be
cross-platform, high-performance, secure, and reliable. The libraries are bound
to C++ by the [aws-crt-cpp](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-cpp) package.

## Installation

### Minimum Requirements
*   C++ 11 or higher
*   CMake 3.1+
*   Clang 3.9+ or GCC 4.4+ or MSVC 2015+


### Build from source
#### Automatically Build and Install AWS Dependencies
```sh
mkdir sdk-cpp-workspace
cd sdk-cpp-workspace
git clone --recursive https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2.git
mkdir aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2-build
cd aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2-build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<absolute path sdk-cpp-workspace dir>"  -DBUILD_DEPS=ON ../aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2
cmake --build . --target install
```
#### Using a Pre-Built aws-crt-cpp (Most useful for development of this package)

```sh
mkdir aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2-build
cd aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2-build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<absolute path sdk-cpp-workspace dir>"  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<absolute path sdk-cpp-workspace dir>" -DBUILD_DEPS=OFF ../aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2
cmake --build . --target install
```

### Mac-Only TLS Behavior

Please note that on Mac, once a private key is used with a certificate, that certificate-key pair is imported into the Mac Keychain.  All subsequent uses of that certificate will use the stored private key and ignore anything passed in programmatically.  Beginning in v1.7.3, when a stored private key from the Keychain is used, the following will be logged at the "info" log level:

```
static: certificate has an existing certificate-key pair that was previously imported into the Keychain.  Using key from Keychain instead of the one provided.
```
