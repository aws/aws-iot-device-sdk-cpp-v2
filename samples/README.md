* [Greengrass discovery](#greengrass-discovery)

## Build Instruction

You can build the samples either separate or together.

Firstly, build aws-iot-devices-sdk-cpp-v2 with following instructions:

``` sh
mkdir sdk-cpp-workspace
cd sdk-cpp-workspace
git clone --recursive https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2.git
mkdir aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2-build
cd aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2-build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<absolute path sdk-cpp-workspace dir>"  -DBUILD_DEPS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```

### Separate build each sample

Change directory into one of the samples. Under the directory of the sample, run the following commands:

``` sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<absolute path sdk-cpp-workspace dir>"  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build . --config Release --target install

```

### Build samples together

under aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2-build directory, run the following commands:

``` sh
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<absolute path sdk-cpp-workspace dir>"  -DBUILD_DEPS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SAMPLES=ON ../aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```

**Note: for linux machine, you may need to indicate the path to libcrypto, by adding the following configuration to the cmake config process:**
- LibCrypto_INCLUDE_DIR="\<path to include dir\>"
- LibCrypto_STATIC_LIBRARY="\<path to libcrypto.a file\>"

## Basic MQTT Pub-Sub

This sample uses the
[Message Broker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-message-broker.html)
for AWS IoT to send and receive messages through an MQTT connection.
On startup, the device connects to the server and subscribes to a topic.

The terminal prompts the user for input. Type something and press enter to publish a message to the topic.
Since the sample is subscribed to the same topic, it will also receive the message back from the server.
Type `quit` and press enter to end the sample.

To run the basic MQTT Pub-Sub use the following command:

``` sh
./basic-pub-sub --endpoint <endpoint> --ca_file <path to root CA>
--cert <path to the certificate> --key <path to the private key>
--topic <topic name>
```

## Raw MQTT Pub-Sub

This sample is similar to the Basic Pub-Sub, but the connection setup is more manual.
This is a starting point for using custom
[Configurable Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-custom-endpoints-configurable.html).

source: `samples/mqtt/raw_pub_sub`

## Fleet provisioning

This sample uses the AWS IoT
[Fleet provisioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/provision-wo-cert.html)
to provision devices using either a CSR or KeysAndcertificate and subsequently calls RegisterThing.

On startup, the script subscribes to topics based on the request type of either CSR or Keys topics,
publishes the request to corresponding topic and calls RegisterThing.

Source: `samples/identity/fleet_provisioning`
cd ~/aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2-build/samples/identity/fleet_provisioning

Run the sample like this to provision using CreateKeysAndCertificate:

``` sh
./fleet-provisioning --endpoint <endpoint> --ca_file <path to root CA>
--cert <path to the certificate> --key <path to the private key>
--template_name <template name> --template_parameters <template parameters json>
```

Run the sample like this to provision using Csr:

``` sh
./fleet-provisioning --endpoint <endpoint> --ca_file <path to root CA>
--cert <path to the certificate> --key <path to the private key>
--template_name <template name> --template_parameters <template parameters json> --csr <path to the CSR in PEM format>
```

## Shadow

This sample uses the AWS IoT
[Device Shadow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html)
Service to keep a property in
sync between device and server. Imagine a light whose color may be changed
through an app, or set by a local user.

Once connected, type a value in the terminal and press Enter to update
the property's "reported" value. The sample also responds when the "desired"
value changes on the server. To observe this, edit the Shadow document in
the AWS Console and set a new "desired" value.

On startup, the sample requests the shadow document to learn the property's
initial state. The sample also subscribes to "delta" events from the server,
which are sent when a property's "desired" value differs from its "reported"
value. When the sample learns of a new desired value, that value is changed
on the device and an update is sent to the server with the new "reported"
value.

## Jobs

This sample uses the AWS IoT
[Jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-jobs.html)
Service to describe jobs to execute.

This sample requires you to create jobs for your device to execute. See
[instructions here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-manage-jobs.html).

On startup, the sample describes a job that is pending execution.

## Greengrass discovery

This sample is intended for direct usage with the Greengrass tutorial found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/gg-gs.html).
