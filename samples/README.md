* [Greengrass IPC](#greengrass-ipc)

## Build Instruction

Firstly, build and install aws-iot-devices-sdk-cpp-v2 with following instructions from [Installation](../README.md#Installation).

### Build samples

Change directory into one of the samples. Under the directory of the sample, run the following commands:

``` sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<absolute path sdk-cpp-workspace dir>" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="<Release|RelWithDebInfo|Debug>" ..
cmake --build . --config "<Release|RelWithDebInfo|Debug>"
```

#### Note

* `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` needs to be set to the path aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2 installed. Since [Installation](../README.md#Installation) takes sdk-cpp-workspace as an example, here takes that as an example too.

* `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` and `--config` needs to match the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE when aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2 built. `--config` is only REQUIRED for multi-configuration build tools.

## Basic MQTT Pub-Sub

This sample uses the
[Message Broker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-message-broker.html)
for AWS IoT to send and receive messages through an MQTT connection.
On startup, the device connects to the server and subscribes to a topic.

The terminal prompts the user for input. Type something and press enter to publish a message to the topic.
Since the sample is subscribed to the same topic, it will also receive the message back from the server.
Type `quit` and press enter to end the sample.

To run the basic MQTT Pub-Sub use the following command:

``` sh
./basic-pub-sub --endpoint <endpoint> --ca_file <path to root CA>
--cert <path to the certificate> --key <path to the private key>
--topic <topic name>
```

## Raw MQTT Pub-Sub

This sample is similar to the Basic Pub-Sub, but the connection setup is more manual.
This is a starting point for using custom
[Configurable Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-custom-endpoints-configurable.html).

source: `samples/mqtt/raw_pub_sub/main.cpp`

## Shadow

This sample uses the AWS IoT
[Device Shadow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html)
Service to keep a property in
sync between device and server. Imagine a light whose color may be changed
through an app, or set by a local user.

Once connected, type a value in the terminal and press Enter to update
the property's "reported" value. The sample also responds when the "desired"
value changes on the server. To observe this, edit the Shadow document in
the AWS Console and set a new "desired" value.

On startup, the sample requests the shadow document to learn the property's
initial state. The sample also subscribes to "delta" events from the server,
which are sent when a property's "desired" value differs from its "reported"
value. When the sample learns of a new desired value, that value is changed
on the device and an update is sent to the server with the new "reported"
value.

## Jobs

This sample uses the AWS IoT
[Jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-jobs.html)
Service to describe jobs to execute.

This sample requires you to create jobs for your device to execute. See
[instructions here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-manage-jobs.html).

On startup, the sample describes a job that is pending execution.

## Fleet provisioning

This sample uses the AWS IoT
[Fleet provisioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/provision-wo-cert.html)
to provision devices using either a CSR or KeysAndcertificate and subsequently calls RegisterThing.

On startup, the script subscribes to topics based on the request type of either CSR or Keys topics,
publishes the request to corresponding topic and calls RegisterThing.

Source: `samples/identity/fleet_provisioning/main.cpp`

Run the sample like this to provision using CreateKeysAndCertificate:

``` sh
./fleet-provisioning --endpoint <endpoint> --ca_file <path to root CA>
--cert <path to the certificate> --key <path to the private key>
--template_name <template name> --template_parameters <template parameters json>
```

Run the sample like this to provision using Csr:

``` sh
./fleet-provisioning --endpoint <endpoint> --ca_file <path to root CA>
--cert <path to the certificate> --key <path to the private key>
--template_name <template name> --template_parameters <template parameters json> --csr <path to the CSR in PEM format>
```

### Fleet Provisioning Detailed Instructions

#### Aws Resource Setup

Fleet provisioning requires some additional AWS resources be set up first. This section documents the steps you need to take to
get the sample up and running. These steps assume you have the AWS CLI installed and the default user/credentials has
sufficient permission to perform all of the listed operations. You will also need python3 to be able to run parse_cert_set_result.py. These steps are based on provisioning setup steps
that can be found at [Embedded C SDK Setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/lib-ref/c-sdk/provisioning/provisioning_tests.html#provisioning_system_tests_setup).

First, create the IAM role that will be needed by the fleet provisioning template. Replace `RoleName` with a name of the role you want to create. 
``` sh
aws iam create-role \
    --role-name [RoleName] \
    --assume-role-policy-document '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Action":"sts:AssumeRole","Effect":"Allow","Principal":{"Service":"iot.amazonaws.com"}}]}'
```
Next, attach a policy to the role created in the first step. Replace `RoleName` with the name of the role you created previously.
``` sh
aws iam attach-role-policy \
        --role-name [RoleName] \
        --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSIoTThingsRegistration
```
Finally, create the template resource which will be used for provisioning by the demo application. This needs to be done only 
once.  To create a template, the following AWS CLI command may be used. Replace `TemplateName` with the name of the fleet 
provisioning template you want to create. Replace `RoleName` with the name of the role you created previously. Replace 
`TemplateJSON` with the template body as a JSON string (containing escape characters). Replace `account` with your AWS 
account number. 
``` sh
aws iot create-provisioning-template \
        --template-name [TemplateName] \
        --provisioning-role-arn arn:aws:iam::[account]:role/[RoleName] \
        --template-body "[TemplateJSON]" \
        --enabled 
```
The rest of the instructions assume you have used the following for the template body:
``` sh
{\"Parameters\":{\"DeviceLocation\":{\"Type\":\"String\"},\"AWS::IoT::Certificate::Id\":{\"Type\":\"String\"},\"SerialNumber\":{\"Type\":\"String\"}},\"Mappings\":{\"LocationTable\":{\"Seattle\":{\"LocationUrl\":\"https://example.aws\"}}},\"Resources\":{\"thing\":{\"Type\":\"AWS::IoT::Thing\",\"Properties\":{\"ThingName\":{\"Fn::Join\":[\"\",[\"ThingPrefix_\",{\"Ref\":\"SerialNumber\"}]]},\"AttributePayload\":{\"version\":\"v1\",\"serialNumber\":\"serialNumber\"}},\"OverrideSettings\":{\"AttributePayload\":\"MERGE\",\"ThingTypeName\":\"REPLACE\",\"ThingGroups\":\"DO_NOTHING\"}},\"certificate\":{\"Type\":\"AWS::IoT::Certificate\",\"Properties\":{\"CertificateId\":{\"Ref\":\"AWS::IoT::Certificate::Id\"},\"Status\":\"Active\"},\"OverrideSettings\":{\"Status\":\"REPLACE\"}},\"policy\":{\"Type\":\"AWS::IoT::Policy\",\"Properties\":{\"PolicyDocument\":{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"iot:Connect\",\"iot:Subscribe\",\"iot:Publish\",\"iot:Receive\"],\"Resource\":\"*\"}]}}}},\"DeviceConfiguration\":{\"FallbackUrl\":\"https://www.example.com/test-site\",\"LocationUrl\":{\"Fn::FindInMap\":[\"LocationTable\",{\"Ref\":\"DeviceLocation\"},\"LocationUrl\"]}}}
```
If you use a different body, you may need to pass in different template parameters.

#### Running the sample and provisioning using a certificate-key set from a provisioning claim

To run the provisioning sample, you'll need a certificate and key set with sufficient permissions. Provisioning certificates are normally 
created ahead of time and placed on your device, but for this sample, we will just create them on the fly. You can also
use any certificate set you've already created if it has sufficient IoT permissions and in doing so, you can skip the step
that calls `create-provisioning-claim`.
 
We've included a script in the utils folder that creates certificate and key files from the response of calling
`create-provisioning-claim`. These dynamically sourced certificates are only valid for five minutes. When running the command, 
you'll need to substitute the name of the template you previously created, and on Windows, replace the paths with something appropriate.

(Optional) Create a temporary provisioning claim certificate set. This command is executed in the debug folder(`aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2-build\samples\identity\fleet_provisioning\Debug`):
``` sh
aws iot create-provisioning-claim \
        --template-name [TemplateName] \
        | python3 ../../../../../aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2/utils/parse_cert_set_result.py \
        --path /tmp \
        --filename provision
```

The provisioning claim's cert and key set have been written to `/tmp/provision*`. Now you can use these temporary keys
to perform the actual provisioning. If you are not using the temporary provisioning certificate, replace the paths for `--cert` 
and `--key` appropriately:

``` sh
./fleet-provisioning \
        --endpoint [your endpoint]-ats.iot.[region].amazonaws.com \
        --ca_file [pathToRootCA] \
        --cert /tmp/provision.cert.pem \
        --key /tmp/provision.private.key \
        --template_name [TemplateName] \
        --template_parameters "{\"SerialNumber\":\"1\",\"DeviceLocation\":\"Seattle\"}"
```

Notice that we provided substitution values for the two parameters in the template body, `DeviceLocation` and `SerialNumber`.

#### Run the sample using the certificate signing request workflow

To run the sample with this workflow, you'll need to create a certificate signing request.

First create a certificate-key pair:
``` sh
openssl genrsa -out /tmp/deviceCert.key 2048
```

Next create a certificate signing request from it:
``` sh
openssl req -new -key /tmp/deviceCert.key -out /tmp/deviceCert.csr
```

(Optional) As with the previous workflow, we'll create a temporary certificate set from a provisioning claim. This step can
be skipped if you're using a certificate set capable of provisioning the device. This command is executed in the debug folder(`aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2-build\samples\identity\fleet_provisioning\Debug`):

``` sh
aws iot create-provisioning-claim \
        --template-name [TemplateName] \
        | python3 ../../../../../aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2/utils/parse_cert_set_result.py \
        --path /tmp \
        --filename provision
```

Finally, supply the certificate signing request while invoking the provisioning sample. As with the previous workflow, if
using a permanent certificate set, replace the paths specified in the `--cert` and `--key` arguments:
``` sh
./fleet-provisioning \
        --endpoint [your endpoint]-ats.iot.[region].amazonaws.com \
        --ca_file [pathToRootCA] \
        --cert /tmp/provision.cert.pem \
        --key /tmp/provision.private.key \
        --template_name [TemplateName] \
        --template_parameters "{\"SerialNumber\":\"1\",\"DeviceLocation\":\"Seattle\"}" \
        --csr /tmp/deviceCert.csr
```

## Secure Tunnel

This sample uses AWS IoT [Secure Tunneling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/secure-tunneling.html) Service to connect a destination and a source with each other through the AWS Secure Tunnel endpoint using access tokens.

Create a new secure tunnel in the AWS IoT console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/) (AWS IoT/Manage/Tunnels/Create tunnel) and retrieve the destination and source access tokens. (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/secure-tunneling-tutorial-open-tunnel.html)

Provide the necessary arguments along with the destination access token and start the sample in destination mode (default).

Provide the necessary arguments along with the source access token and start a second sample in source mode by using the flag --localProxyModeSource.

The two samples will then connect to each other through the AWS Secure Tunnel endpoint and establish a stream through which data can be trasmitted in either direction.

A proxy server may be used by providing the --proxy_host and --proxy_port arguments. If the proxy server requires a user name and password the --proxy_user_name and --proxy_password arguments should be used.

Source: `samples/secure_tunneling/secure_tunnel`

## Secure Tunnel Notification

This sample uses the AWS IoT [Secure Tunneling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/secure-tunneling.html) Service to receive a tunnel notification.

This sample requires you to create a tunnel for your thing. See [instructions here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/secure-tunneling-tutorial.html).

On startup, the sample will wait until it receives, and then displays the tunnel notification.

Source: `samples/secure_tunneling/tunnel_notification`

## Greengrass discovery

This sample is intended for direct usage with the Greengrass Discovery tutorial found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/gg-gs.html).

## Greengrass IPC

This sample must be run from within a Greengrass V2 component using an appropriate policy to perform `aws.greengrass#PublishToIoTCore` and `aws.greengrass#SubscribeToIoTCore` operations on `test/topic` or any other topic passed as a CLI argument.

For more information about Greengrass interprocess communication (IPC), see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/interprocess-communication.html). This sample uses IPC to perform [IoT Core MQTT operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/ipc-iot-core-mqtt.html).
