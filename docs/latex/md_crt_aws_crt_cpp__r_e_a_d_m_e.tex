More protocols and utilities are coming soon, so stay tuned.\hypertarget{md_crt_aws_crt_cpp__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md612}{}\doxysection{Building}\label{md_crt_aws_crt_cpp__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md612}
The C99 libraries are already included for your convenience as submodules. If you would like to have us build them by default, be sure to either perform a recursive clone {\ttfamily git clone -\/-\/recursive} or initialize the submodules via. {\ttfamily git submodule update -\/-\/init}. Then, to build, specify the {\ttfamily -\/DBUILD\+\_\+\+DEPS=ON} CMake argument.

If you want to manage these dependencies manually (e.\+g. you\textquotesingle{}re using them in other projects), simply specify {\ttfamily -\/DCMAKE\+\_\+\+PREFIX\+\_\+\+PATH} to point to the absolute path where you have them installed.\hypertarget{md_crt_aws_crt_cpp__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md613}{}\doxysubsection{MSVC}\label{md_crt_aws_crt_cpp__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md613}
If you want to use a statically linked MSVCRT (/\+MT, /\+MTd), you can add {\ttfamily -\/DSTATIC\+\_\+\+CRT=ON} to your cmake configuration.\hypertarget{md_crt_aws_crt_cpp__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md614}{}\doxysection{Dependencies?}\label{md_crt_aws_crt_cpp__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md614}

There are no non-\/\+OS dependencies that AWS does not own, maintain, and ship.\hypertarget{md_crt_aws_crt_cpp__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md616}{}\doxysubsection{Unix}\label{md_crt_aws_crt_cpp__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md616}
The most likely answer is\+: none that you should care about.

We do depend on an openssl compatible libcrypto implementation being in your path if you are on a unix system. Note\+: we do not actually use libssl. The most likely scenario is that libcrypto is already installed on your system. However, since many linux distributions these days do not provide a 32-\/bit libcrypto package, if you\textquotesingle{}re trying to perform a 32-\/bit build you will likely need to build and install libcrypto from source.\hypertarget{md_crt_aws_crt_cpp__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md617}{}\doxysection{Common Usage}\label{md_crt_aws_crt_cpp__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md617}
To do anything with IO, you\textquotesingle{}ll need to create a few objects that will be used by the rest of the library.

For example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Aws::Crt::LoadErrorStrings();}

\end{DoxyCode}


Will load error strings for debugging purposes. Since the C libraries use error codes, this will allow you to print the corresponding error string for each error code.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Aws::Crt::ApiHandle apiHandle;}

\end{DoxyCode}
 This performs one-\/time static initialization of the library. You\textquotesingle{}ll need it to do anything, so don\textquotesingle{}t forget to create one.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Aws::Crt::Io::EventLoopGroup eventLoopGroup(<number of threads you want>);}

\end{DoxyCode}
 To use any of our APIs that perform IO you\textquotesingle{}ll need at least one event-\/loop. An event-\/loop group is a collection of event-\/loops that protocol implementations will load balance across. If you won\textquotesingle{}t have very many connections (say, more than 100 or so), then you most likely only want 1 thread. In this case, you want to pass a single instance of this to every client or server implementation of a protocol you use in your application. In some advanced use cases, you may want to reserve a thread for different types of IO tasks. In that case, you can have an instance of this class for each reservation.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ Aws::Crt::Io::TlsContextOptions tlsCtxOptions =}
\DoxyCodeLine{    Aws::Crt::Io::TlsContextOptions::InitClientWithMtls(certificatePath.c\_str(), keyPath.c\_str());}
\DoxyCodeLine{/*}
\DoxyCodeLine{ * If we have a custom CA, set that up here.}
\DoxyCodeLine{ */}
\DoxyCodeLine{if (!caFile.empty())}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    tlsCtxOptions.OverrideDefaultTrustStore(nullptr, caFile.c\_str());}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{uint16\_t port = 8883;}
\DoxyCodeLine{if (Io::TlsContextOptions::IsAlpnSupported())}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    /*}
\DoxyCodeLine{    * Use ALPN to negotiate the mqtt protocol on a normal}
\DoxyCodeLine{    * TLS port if possible.}
\DoxyCodeLine{    */}
\DoxyCodeLine{    tlsCtxOptions.SetAlpnList("{}x-\/amzn-\/mqtt-\/ca"{});}
\DoxyCodeLine{    port = 443;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Aws::Crt::Io::TlsContext tlsCtx(tlsCtxOptions, Io::TlsMode::CLIENT);}

\end{DoxyCode}


If you plan on using TLS, you will need a Tls\+Context. These are NOT CHEAP, so use as few as possible to perform your task. If you\textquotesingle{}re in client mode and not doing anything fancy (e.\+g. mutual TLS), then you can likely get away with using a single instance for the entire application.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Aws::Crt::Io::ClientBootstrap bootstrap(eventLoopGroup);}

\end{DoxyCode}


Lastly, you will need a client or server bootstrap to use a client or server protocol implementation. Since everything is non-\/blocking and event driven, this handles most of the \char`\"{}callback hell\char`\"{} inherent in the design. Assuming you aren\textquotesingle{}t partitioning threads for particular use-\/cases, you can have a single instance of this that you pass to multiple clients.\hypertarget{md_crt_aws_crt_cpp__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md618}{}\doxysection{Mac-\/\+Only TLS Behavior}\label{md_crt_aws_crt_cpp__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md618}
Please note that on Mac, once a private key is used with a certificate, that certificate-\/key pair is imported into the Mac Keychain. All subsequent uses of that certificate will use the stored private key and ignore anything passed in programmatically. Beginning in v0.\+8.\+10, when a stored private key from the Keychain is used, the following will be logged at the \char`\"{}info\char`\"{} log level\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{static: certificate has an existing certificate-\/key pair that was previously imported into the Keychain.  Using key from Keychain instead of the one provided.}
