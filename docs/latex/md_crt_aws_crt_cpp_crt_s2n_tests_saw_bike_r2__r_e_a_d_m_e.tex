This is a SAW memory safety only proof of the C implementation of BIKE R2. It guarantees that there is not any undefined behavior (e.\+g. segmentation faults, memory safety violations, etc) when the BIKE code is compiled through the LLVM toolchain and executed.\hypertarget{md_crt_aws_crt_cpp_crt_s2n_tests_saw_bike_r2__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md571}{}\doxysection{Limitations}\label{md_crt_aws_crt_cpp_crt_s2n_tests_saw_bike_r2__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md571}
The proof makes the following assumptions\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the specifications of Open\+SSL functions are accurate.
\item {\ttfamily get\+\_\+threshold} does not exhibit any undefined behavior. This is because SAW does not support floating-\/point arithmetic. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
