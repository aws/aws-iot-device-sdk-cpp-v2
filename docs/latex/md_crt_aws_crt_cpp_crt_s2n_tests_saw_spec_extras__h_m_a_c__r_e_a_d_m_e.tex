These are files detailing the verification of HMAC with respect to the HMAC specification provided by Andrew Appel\textquotesingle{}s HMAC verification effort.

The files in this repository constitue a proof of equivalence between the \href{../../HMAC.cry}{\texttt{ Cryptol specification of HMAC}} and the \href{HMAC_spec.v}{\texttt{ HMAC specification}} used for the FCF proof of HMAC.

This proof of equivalence is done through a \href{https://github.com/GaloisInc/cryptol-semantics}{\texttt{ mechanized semantics of Cryptol}}.

You can read more about the FCF proof of correctness for HMAC in \href{https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/verified-hmac.pdf}{\texttt{ this paper}}

These files don\textquotesingle{}t build by themselves, but rather require the \href{https://github.com/GaloisInc/cryptol-semantics}{\texttt{ cryptol-\/semantics repository}} checked out and built in the same directory as s2n.

These is verification effort used Coq 8.\+6, if you use a different version YMMV.

Build instructions\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Build the cryptol-\/semantics repository
\item make (in this directory)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

NOTE\+: When you make you may see some warnings about ambiguous paths, as the cryptol-\/semantics repository contains all of these files as well.
