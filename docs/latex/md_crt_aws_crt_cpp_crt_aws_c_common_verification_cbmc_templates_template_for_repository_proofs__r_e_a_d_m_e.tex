This directory contains the CBMC proofs. Each proof is in its own directory.

This directory includes four Makefiles.

One Makefile describes the basic workflow for building and running proofs\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Makefile.\+common\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item make\+: builds the goto binary, does the cbmc property checking and coverage checking, and builds the final report.
\item make goto\+: builds the goto binary
\item make result\+: does cbmc property checking
\item make coverage\+: does cbmc coverage checking
\item make report\+: builds the final report
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Three included Makefiles describe project-\/specific settings and can override definitions in Makefile.\+common\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Makefile-\/project-\/defines\+: definitions like compiler flags required to build the goto binaries, and definitions to override definitions in Makefile.\+common.
\item Makefile-\/project-\/targets\+: other make targets needed for the project
\item Makefile-\/project-\/testing\+: other definitions and targets needed for unit testing or continuous integration. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
