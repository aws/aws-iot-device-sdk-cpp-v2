This is a SAW memory safety only proof of the C implementation of BIKE R1. It guarantees that there is not any undefined behavior (e.\+g. segmentation faults, memory safety violations, etc) when the BIKE code is compiled through the LLVM toolchain and executed.\hypertarget{md_crt_aws_crt_cpp_crt_s2n_tests_saw_bike_r1__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md569}{}\doxysection{Limitations}\label{md_crt_aws_crt_cpp_crt_s2n_tests_saw_bike_r1__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md569}
The proof makes the following assumptions\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Calls to Open\+SSL functions always succeed (return 0). The proof does not model that if a call fails then memory is not guaranteed to be written. Manual inspection confirms that the BIKE code defends against this.
\item {\ttfamily get\+\_\+rand\+\_\+mod\+\_\+len} always generates the random position before {\ttfamily aes\+\_\+ctr\+\_\+prf} runs out of invocations.
\item {\ttfamily get\+\_\+threshold} does not exhibit any undefined behavior. This is because SAW does not support floating-\/point arithmetic.
