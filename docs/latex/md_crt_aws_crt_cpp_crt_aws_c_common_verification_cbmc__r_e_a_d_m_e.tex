 It is expected that the repository contains a directory {\ttfamily .cbmc-\/batch}, which itself contains a directory {\ttfamily jobs}. Each directory in {\ttfamily .cbmc-\/batch/jobs} should correspond to a CBMC Batch job. Each job directory must contain a {\ttfamily Makefile} to be used by CBMC Batch to build the goto for CBMC and a {\ttfamily cbmc-\/batch.\+yaml} file to provide CBMC Batch options and provide an expected substring in the result of the CBMC run.\hypertarget{md_crt_aws_crt_cpp_crt_aws_c_common_verification_cbmc__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md104}{}\doxysection{Running Locally}\label{md_crt_aws_crt_cpp_crt_aws_c_common_verification_cbmc__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md104}
In order to start the CBMC Batch jobs and check results locally, you need to have installed CBMC Batch.

You can start the CBMC Batch jobs locally by running \begin{DoxyVerb}bash cbmc-batch.sh --start
\end{DoxyVerb}
 You can then check CBMC Batch results locally by running \begin{DoxyVerb}bash cbmc-batch.sh --end
\end{DoxyVerb}
 This will run until all the jobs have finished and output results in {\ttfamily results.\+txt}.

You can clean up the local CBMC Batch bookkeeping files by running \begin{DoxyVerb}bash cbmc-batch.sh --cleanup
\end{DoxyVerb}
