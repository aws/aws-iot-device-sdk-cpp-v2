This package is an \char`\"{}additional optimized\char`\"{} implementation of the Round-\/2 variant of BIKE-\/1.

BIKE is a submission to the Post-\/\+Quantum Cryptography Standardization project \href{http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography}{\texttt{ http\+://csrc.\+nist.\+gov/projects/post-\/quantum-\/cryptography}}.

The official BIKE website is\+: \href{https://bikesuite.org}{\texttt{ https\+://bikesuite.\+org}}

This package offers a constant time implementations of Round-\/2 BIKE-\/1.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A portable implementation that requires libcrypto.\+a (e.\+g., of Open\+SSL) for AES256 and SHA384.

The decoder (in decoder/decoder.\+c) algorithm is the Black-\/\+Gray decoder included in the early submission of CAKE (due to N. Sandrier and R. Misoczki).

The code is due to Nir Drucker, Shay Gueron (and Dusan Kostic for the Round-\/2 flows).
